JustTestLah! is an end-to-end UI testing framework for mobile and web applications. It started as a demonstration project to showcase concepts shared during [tech talks and conferences](https://github.com/martinschneider/presentations).

This framework follows a [BDD](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html) approach and allows testing on different platforms (Android, iOS and Web) using the same test scenarios. JustTestLah's main aim is to make the configuration as easy and the test code as simple, readable and maintainable as possible.

JustTestLah! is based on [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org) and [Appium](https://www.appium.io).

## Quick start
Pull the repo and run the demo (a set of simple tests for Stackoverflow):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/martinschneider/justtestlah.git
cd justtestlah-demos
mvn test
```
